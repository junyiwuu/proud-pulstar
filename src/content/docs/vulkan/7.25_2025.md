Set up the structure of asset:

* Asset: including two shared pointer: Model and Material
* Material load in Texture (shared pointer)
	* After load in Texture, Material need "build", so it can write texture into descriptor set (of this Material)
* When creating a material, a descriptor set is automatically created
* Descriptor set layout: set 0 is for uniform buffer, set 1 is for PBR (potentially, now only has Albedo)


* Descriptor Allocator is initialized with Rendering System, one pool is created
	* When need more descriptor type, pool size need to be modified
	* Descriptor Allocator is shared pointer, because inside has sets counter, it helps to dynamically expanding the descriptor pool.
	* When requiring locate more sets than current pool's capacity, the sets counter will ++. and create the new corresponding pool.
