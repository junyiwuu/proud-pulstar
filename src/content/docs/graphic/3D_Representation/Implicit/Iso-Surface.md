## What is Iso-Surface
- It is a surface that represents points of a constant value within a vulome of space.
- It is a level set of a continuous function whose domain is 3-space.

It is a term for the surface of SDF.
For example, we have a SDF representation of a ball, $f(x)=∥x−c∥−r，$ , when it equals to 0, we have the ball which has radius of $r$, then this surface (when equals to 0) is iso-surface
